# [Spawn](http://suikacraft.com)

Spawn is a Forge mod for Minecraft that works in conjunction with our *[Sky](https://github.com/yurisuika/Sky)* dimension mod. It manages spawning on the SuikaCraft server. Currently the values are hardcoded, but these can be made configurable in the future if anyone wants to use this for their own server running Sky.

## FEATURES

## DOWNLOADS

### Source Building

To build from source you will need have JDK 8 to compile and, optionally, Git to clone the repository. Otherwise, download the archive and just run `./gradlew build` from the root project folder.

#### Commands

When using Git, just choose a directory you wish to keep the project root folder in, then run these commands:

```shell script
git clone --recursive https://github.com/yurisuika/spawn.git

cd ./spawn

./gradlew build
```

Afterwards, your compiled JAR will be in `./build/libs`.

### Released Builds
