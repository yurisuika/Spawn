**Spawn** is a Forge mod for Minecraft that works in conjunction with our *[Sky](https://github.com/yurisuika/Sky)* dimension mod. It manages spawning on the SuikaCraft server. Currently the values are hardcoded, but these can be made configurable in the future if anyone wants to use this for their own server running Sky.

#### Compiling

To build from source you will need have JDK 8 to compile and, optionally, Git to clone the repository. Otherwise, download the archive and just run `./gradlew build` from the root project folder.

When using Git, just choose a directory you wish to keep the project root folder in, decide which branch you wish to compile, and then run these commands:

```shell script
git clone --branch Forge-1.16 --recursive https://github.com/yurisuika/spawn.git

cd ./spawn

./gradlew build
```

Afterwards, your compiled JAR will be in `./build/libs`.
